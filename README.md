# Spotify-Muter
I do not like Spotify ads, so I created an app that mutes Spotify any time an ad pops up, and un-mutes when the ads are finished.

This program is actually very simple. The program continually reads the title of the Spotify window, which is changed based on what song is playing.
If it is an actual song, the format will be "ARTIST - SONGNAME". However, if an ad is currently playing, the format will most likely not match. 
Every so often, an ad will pop up with the exact format, but can be added to an artist blacklist by pushing the simple button on the GUI.
